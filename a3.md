# Part D: Reflections


## Reflection for hsingh746

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.<br>
  Completing this assignment was quite an interesting experience. I learned a lot about data structures and algorithms through the practical implementation of MinHeap, Prim's algorithm, and maze generation.
2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?<br>
  One thing I learned was the importance of choosing the right data structures and algorithms for the task. For example, using a MinHeap greatly improved the efficiency of selecting edges with the minimum weight in Prim's algorithm, leading to a more optimized solution.
3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?<br>
  The most challenging aspect was implementing the maze generation algorithm. Initially, grasping the concept of generating corridors using the minimum spanning tree was a bit challenging. However, I overcame this challenge by breaking down the process step by step and visualizing the intermediate results. Additionally, debugging and ensuring that the maze was generated correctly took some time and effort.
